# This is there to learn git

learn cloning in local add and do some commit then push it here

# when you have repo in git first 

- 1 clone the repo 
- 2 git add file you want to change for staged
- 3 commit changes with this command  =>  ``` git commit -m "message goes here" ```
- 4 push you changes to github using  ```git push -u origin main ``` 
    used -u flag so you don't need to use origin main again and again every time you push
